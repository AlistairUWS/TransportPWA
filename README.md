# TransportPWA
This app is an update of my original TransportAPI app which now uses the Progressive Web App architecture.
The app provides an installable PWA for iPhone or Android which uses the Scotrail timetable service to get platform and schedule details for SINGLE train journeys on the Scotrail network.  (A single journey here is defined as one in which there will be no change of train during the journey - this is limited but adequate for my own purposes.)
The app uses the TransportAPI service (https://www.transportapi.com/) to collect schedule data and incorporates GPS to get the four nearest stations to a user's location.  Journey details can be saved in a quick list.
The app was originally used in teaching students to create web-apps, hence its simplicity.
